# ESP32 Deej Controller with Rotary Encoders and Display

This project allows you to control audio sliders in **deej** using an ESP32 with two rotary encoders and a display. One rotary encoder loops through the available sliders, and the other adjusts the volume levels in real-time.

> **Note:** This is a very early version, but it should work!

## Features
- Two rotary encoders: one to select sliders and another to control volume.
- Display to show the currently selected slider and its volume level.
- JSON-based configuration for customization of slider names and values.

## Required Hardware
1. **ESP32** development board (e.g., ESP32 Wroom; other ESP32 variants will work with minor tweaks).
2. **2 Rotary Encoders** (I used HW-040, but similar encoders can be used).
3. **Display** (e.g., OLED or LCD compatible with ESP32). 
   - I used the **SH1106 1.3-inch I2C OLED 128x64** display. If you use a different display, you may need to modify the code accordingly.

- **CLK** â†’ D15

### Rotary Encoder 2:
- **GND** â†’ GND
- **+** â†’ 3.3V
- **SW** â†’ D21
- **DT** â†’ D19
- **CLK** â†’ D18

### Display (I2C):

## Setup Instructions
1. Install **deej** on your computer: [Get deej here](https://github.com/omriharel/deej).
2. Flash the provided Arduino code to your ESP32.
3. Connect the ESP32 to your computer via USB.
4. Connect to the DEEJ WiFi network and navigate to 192.168.4.1
6. Run **deej** on your computer, and configure it to recognize the serial input from the ESP32.
7. Test the rotary encoders to navigate sliders and control volume.

## JSON Customization
The project supports a simple JSON structure for defining sliders. Update this configuration to match your preferred setup:

```json
{
    "num_sliders": 3,
    "sliders": [
        {
            "name": "Main",
            "value": 100,
            "muted": false,
            "previous_value": 100
        },
        {
            "name": "System",
            "value": 100,
            "muted": false,
            "previous_value": 100
        },
        {
            "name": "Mic",
            "value": 100,
            "muted": false,
            "previous_value": 100
        }
    ]
}
```
### How to Use JSON Configuration:
- `num_sliders`: Total number of sliders.
- `name`: The display name of the slider (e.g., Main, System, Mic).
- `value`: Initial volume level (0-100).
- `muted`: Set to `true` or `false` to mute/unmute the slider.
- `previous_value`: Stores the last unmuted value for easy recovery.

Update these values and upload the JSON to the **ESP32 web UI** to customize the sliders.
